- Common small phone size
- Test: Select "iPhone SE" in DevTools

### 3. **480px** (Transition point)
- Where many layouts adjust
- Test: Set custom viewport to 480px

### 4. **768px** (Tablet / Large phone landscape)
- Where hamburger menu appears/disappears
- Test: Select "iPad Mini" or custom 768px

### 5. **968px** (Small laptops)
- Final breakpoint before desktop
- Test: Custom viewport 968px

## 🔧 Common Issues to Look For

### ❌ Problem: Horizontal scroll appears
**Solution:** Check if any element has fixed width larger than viewport

### ❌ Problem: Text is too small to read
**Solution:** Already fixed with responsive font sizes

### ❌ Problem: Buttons too small to tap
**Solution:** Already fixed with min-height: 48px

### ❌ Problem: iOS zooms when tapping form inputs
**Solution:** Already fixed with font-size: 16px on inputs
